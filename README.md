# chainvoted

This is a hackthon project, the goal is to build trustworthy voting system, no body can fake the result of poll.

1st version, the client need to connect with Wallet Extension to vote (with paying gas fee), but it will blocks users accumulation for a brand new project.

2nd version, we decided accumulation first, so lowering down the entry threshold, as long as you have social id, then you are able to vote
